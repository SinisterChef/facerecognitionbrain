# Getting Started with Dank Brain

Dank Brain is a React app that takes user submitted images URLs and queries them to the Clarifai API and which returns, if there are faces, bounding box coordinates.
From there a React component takes the coordinates, parses them into usable inline style CSS inset box location based within the image.
